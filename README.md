Getting a Cleaning Data Project 
In this directory you would find 3 files:
1.	README.txt that is actually the one in where you would find the information of every file inside of the directory. 
2.	run_analisys.R is the R programming file in where all the analysis was made. 
3.	CodeBook is a txt where you will find the information of every variable that was used during the analysis in run_analisys.R. 

The analysis correspond to the fallowing questions:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set.
